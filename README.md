# gild

Key-first identity for the forge, in your terminal. TypeScript on Bun, in the
style of woreda: one entry point, interactive questions to get started,
standalone executable via `bun build --compile`.

## commands

```sh
gild init      # create your ed25519 identity key (asks questions first)
gild whoami    # show this machine's identity
gild auth <challenge>   # sign a browser sign-in challenge
```

The private key lives at `~/.config/gild/identity.json` (mode 0600) and never
leaves the machine. Browser sessions are signed delegations; gild.gg never
sees the key.

## develop

```sh
bun install
bun test
bun run src/gild.ts --help
bun run build   # dist/gild, standalone executable
```
